# Internship
During my internship, I worked on five diverse and impactful Machine Learning projects that span across classification, regression, prediction, and NLP.
These projects demonstrate my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and model data to solve real-world problems using Python and popular ML libraries.

🚀 Projects Overview

1️⃣ Iris Flower Classification 🌸

Goal: Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using sepal and petal measurements.
Key Skills: Supervised Learning, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization.
Highlights:

Used Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset.

Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Achieved high accuracy with minimal preprocessing.

2️⃣ Unemployment Rate Analysis 📉

Goal: Analyze and visualize changes in unemployment rates, especially during Covid-19.
Key Skills: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Storytelling.
Highlights:

Time-series analysis of unemployment rates.

Identified the sharp spike during pandemic months.

Created interactive charts for trend understanding.

3️⃣ Car Price Prediction 🚗

Goal: Predict the selling price of cars based on brand, features, mileage, horsepower, and more.
Key Skills: Regression Models, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation.
Highlights:

Implemented Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

Performed feature importance analysis to identify top influencing factors.

Achieved a low RMSE score, ensuring prediction accuracy.

4️⃣ Email Spam Detection 📧

Goal: Detect and classify emails into Spam or Not Spam using ML & NLP.
Key Skills: Natural Language Processing, Naïve Bayes, TF-IDF Vectorization.
Highlights:

Cleaned and tokenized raw email text.

Applied TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.

Achieved >95% accuracy using Multinomial Naïve Bayes.

5️⃣ Sales Prediction 📈

Goal: Predict future sales based on ad spend, target audience, and marketing platform.
Key Skills: Regression Models, Data Preprocessing, Business Analytics.
Highlights:

Built a regression model to estimate sales outcomes.

Helped demonstrate ROI optimization for marketing.

Created visual insights to support business decision-making.
